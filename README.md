# Spring Boot Learning Journey 🚀

Welcome to my **Spring Boot Learning Repository**! This repository serves as a comprehensive journal documenting my progress as I dive into the world of Spring Boot, a powerful Java-based framework for developing robust, scalable, and production-ready applications.

## 📌 Overview

This repository will cover:
- **Basics of Spring Boot**: Setting up a project, understanding dependencies, and creating a Hello World application.
- **RESTful Services**: Building REST APIs, CRUD operations, and handling HTTP requests.
- **Database Integration**: Working with JPA, Hibernate, and databases like MySQL.
- **Security**: Implementing authentication and authorization using Spring Security.
- **Advanced Features**: Exploring Actuators, scheduling tasks, and file handling.
- **Real-World Projects**: Applying knowledge to practical projects to reinforce learning.

## 🛠️ Tools and Technologies
- **Programming Language**: Java
- **Framework**: Spring Boot
- **Build Tool**: Maven/Gradle
- **IDE**: IntelliJ IDEA / Eclipse
- **Database**: MySQL / PostgreSQL
- **Version Control**: Git & GitHub
